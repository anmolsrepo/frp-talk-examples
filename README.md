Theory and Practice of Functional Reactive JavaScript
=================

This is the basis for the live coding examples I use in my talk. 

- `npm install`
- `gulp`
- `open public/index.html`

There's a `gulp watch` if you want to do some live-coding yourself. 

Bacon-Viz
=========

This repo includes a pre-release version of the bacon-viz tool I've been working on. At some 
point I'll clean it up and get it into a state where it can be used by others. Feel free to bug 
me if you want that to happen sooner than later.
